    "The broadest search you can carry out is for the occurance of a word/phrase (or the absence of one) anywhere in an object record. This is a good starting point in finding an object record matching your search, as it will recall *all* object records containing (or not containing) that word/phrase. However, the relevancy to your interests of the object records returned could be fairly poor, as you may be finding the same word used across multiple meanings, for example searching for China will bring back both objects from that country, objects made using the material, addresses mentioning China, people and organisations with China in their name, and so on. If you already know that you are only looking for objects relating to China the country or the material, you can use a more targeted search parameter ('q_place_name' or 'q_material'), or even better use a filter ('id_place' or 'id_material') (see {ref}`filtering:top`)."
