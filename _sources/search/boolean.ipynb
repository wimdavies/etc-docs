    "Boolean search is a powerful method available in search to help you find the needle in the haystack, by improving the relevancy of the object records returned from a query. But boolean search can escalate in complexity once you start combining its operators, and the subtle interactions between them can become challenging to predict for even those with the most logical of minds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The boolean operators available are:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Phrase Searching - e.g. '\"William Morris\"'\n",
    "  * Negated Searching  - e.g. '-silver'\n",
    "  * AND/OR searching - 'gelato rome' (AND), 'gelato|rome' (OR)\n",
    "  * Fuzzy searching (booleanish) - 'graffito~2'\n",

    "## Phrase searching\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most simple boolean operator to understand, phrase searching allows you to specify that you want an exact phrase (a word or a sequence of words) to be matched, exactly as written. Normally if you search for multiple words, any occurance of the words in isolation anywhere in the record will be considered a match. For example, if you want to search for any objects that contain the words 'William Morris', you may not want to see object records mentioning the (hyperthetical) partnership of \"William Smith\" and \"Jane Morris\" but these would be returned, as they have the words 'William' and 'Morris' somewhere within them. Instead, if you search using double quotes around the words ('\"William Morris\"'), you will now see a smaller number of results that have that exact phrase in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Of course, if you really want to only find objects connected to the Victorian Artist & Designer [William Morris](https://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/william-morris), you would be better use a filter either on the person, or on the maker if you are only interested in objects he was involved in creating, see {doc}`filtering:top`) using the controlled vocab. identifier for William Morris (A8676).\n",

Up until now, without even telling you, we have been defaulting your searches to use AND, so only object records that match on all the terms are returned.
