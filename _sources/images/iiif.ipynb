    " The [International Image Interoperability Framework](https://iiif.io/) standardises the retrieval of images ([Image API](https://iiif.io/api/image/)) allowing for common image operations such as the generation of derivative/scaled images, rotation of images, tiling of images, etc; and the presentation of images ([Presentation API](https://iiif.io/api/presentation/)) which allows for interoperable viewing experiences to be easily built such as page turning, slideshows, stacked images, etc.\n",
    " \n",
    "To make use of both APIs, you will need the identifier for the image (for the Image API) or the object (for the Presentation API). You can find these by using  {ref}`filtering:top` or {ref}`searching:top` to search for objects, in the responses you will see the systemNumber (for object identifiers) and image asset identifiers. There are also some IIIF links in the responses to provide a base URL from which to build your request.\n",
