    "# Keyword filter\n",

    "This type of parameter is a filter, but instead of using an identifier from a controlled vocabulary, it uses the term for the concept itself to match on. This might seem preferable than having to discover some cryptic identifer for a concept such as \"AAT132254\", now you can use the word \"Vase\" instead. However the downside of this is that you are only matching on the exact word you typed, so any variations such as \"Vases\", \"Flower Vase\", \"Set of Vases\", and so on, will not be found. That's why in general controlled vocabularies are a more reliable way of filtering object records (see our previous celebration of the joys of {ref}`filtering:top`). For some keywords though (such as accession year) the year is the identifier so this is the preferred way to filter for that."
